## 📊 Project Overview

Online advertisements are a significant source of revenue for digital platforms. However, irrelevant ads can lower user experience and increase bounce rates. This project leverages user interaction data and machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a user clicking an advertisement.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains user interaction and demographic information. Key features include:

- `Daily Time Spent on Site`
- `Age`
- `Area Income`
- `Daily Internet Usage`
- `Ad Topic Line`
- `City`
- `Gender`
- `Timestamp`
- `Clicked on Ad` (Target Variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)
